# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Using multiple linear regression to predict startups profit

Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression and is used when it is necessary to predict the value of one variable based on the value of two or more other variables.
Multiple regression analysis is also used to assess whether confounding exists. Since multiple linear regression analysis allows us to estimate the association between a given independent variable and the outcome holding all other variables constant, it provides a way of adjusting for (or accounting for) potentially confounding variables that have been included in the model.

The model described in this work uses multiple linear regression, with a data set extracted from the Kaggle repository, which contains the details of 50 startups and predicts the profit of a new startup based on investment in certain resources, and the challenge can be described as follows :

"A venture capitalist has hired you as a data scientist and wants you to help him select which type of company he should invest so that he can make the most profit. You need to review spending on R&D, Admin cost, marketing cost and location to make the decision"
